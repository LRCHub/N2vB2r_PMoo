そこに行けば
どんな夢も
かなうというよ

誰もがみな
行きたがるが
遥かな世界

その国の何はガンダーラ
何処かにあるユートピア
どうしたら行けるのだろう
教えて欲しい

In Gandhara, Gandhara
They say it was in India
Gandhara, Gandhara
愛の国 Gandhara

Though long ago and far
Beyond the winding road
Always beyond every bend
A beautiful land
Still waits for the few
Who make it to the very end

Each man desires to reach Gandahara
His very own utopia
In the striving, in the seeking soul
Man can see Gandahara

In Gandhara, Gandhara
They say it was in India
Gandhara, Gandhara
愛の国 Gandhara

In Gandhara, Gandhara
They say it was in India
Gandhara, Gandhara
愛の国 Gandhara
In Gandhara, Gandhara
They say it was in India
Gandhara, Gandhara
愛の国 Gandhara
